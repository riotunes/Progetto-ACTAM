        <i>PicTune</i> is a web tool imagined and designed to help non-musicians experiment with sound.

      <p class="about-text">
        In the middle of the interface there's a window that provides a graphical response to the input recorded from the user. 
        This fusion between visuals and sound (pics and tunes) is the idea that inspired us to build this web app.
