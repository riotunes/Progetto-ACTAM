        <i>PicTune</i> is a web tool imagined and designed to help to experiment with sound and vision.
        Coming with an accessible and ready-to-use interface, 
        <i>PicTune</i> allows anyone to play with their recordings with their very own style.

      <p class="about-text">
        In the middle of the interface there's a window that provides a graphical response to the input recorded from the user. 
        This fusion between visuals and sound (pics and tunes) is the idea that inspired us to build this web app. 
        <i>PicTune</i> analyzes the intensity, noise and rhythm of the sound. <br>
        Then, it converts it all into the motion of little and colourful musical particles.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h4 class="section-subtitle">Play with the effects</h4>
